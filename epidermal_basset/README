to make models Kipoi compatible, first generated a file of the original
models with checkpoints - `models_orig.tsv`.

this was the input to `run_kipoi_compatibility.py`, which inserted placeholder
ops into the metagraph. these new graphs were saved to a new dir, and
confirmed to run with kipoi test.

these files were uploaded to zenodo with `upload_zenodo.py`.

then the links were put into a new models.tsv table with update_w_zenodo_links.py.

these links were then used with the files to generate a folder for each model.

testing is done per folder, see script `run_tests.py`.
