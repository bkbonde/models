  doc: "This is the extraction of the DNA-part of the a pretrained model by Christof Angermueller.
  The DeepCpG models are trained on: scBS-seq-profiled cells contained 18 serum and 12 2i mESCs, which were pre-processed 
  as described in Smallwood et al. (2014), with reads mapped to the GRCm38 mouse genome. Two serum cells 
  (RSC27_4, RSC27_7) were excluded since their methylation pattern deviated strongly from the remaining serum cells. scRRBS-seq-profiled 
  cells were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE65364) and contained 25 human HCCs, six human 
  heptoplastoma-derived cells (HepG2) and six mESCs. Following Hou et al. (2013), one HCC was excluded (Ca26) and the analysis was 
  restricted to CpG sites that were covered by at least four reads. For HCCs and HepG2 cells, the position of 
  CpG sites was lifted from GRCh37 to GRCh38, and for mESC cells from NCBIM37 to GRCm38, using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser."
